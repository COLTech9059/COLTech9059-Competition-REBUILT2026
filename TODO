--// Vision Goals
  - Basic robot angle to target.
    - Simply read the target observation and center the target within the robot's view. 
    - Utilizes RBSI's new TargetObservation class
  - Full-Field (FF) Odometry
    - Robot is aware of where it is at all times on the field. 
    - Could be used to determine what to activate in a certain region of the field.

--// Outtake (Shooter) Goals
  - Flywheel speed calculation function 
    - based on distance from target

--// Intake Goals
  - idk what the heck you do with a simple intake it's literally just wheels turning

--// Drive Goals
  - (REQUIRES FF ODOMETRY) Modular speed based on field position
    - e.g., Lower speed when driving over the ramp to prevent module damage
  - Vision integration
    - e.g., focus on target while moving (strafing)
    - possibly limited to certain tag numbers?

--// Miscellaneous
  - Lights?
  - Power Optimization? (ADVANCED advanced)
  - Proper PID values?

--// Finalizing
  - no magic numbers (numbers that simply appear in one place; they don't have an identifier)
  - idk what else this is really ahrd to plan :///
  - real, queen, I get it
